# Homework Assignment #1
## KIEI-924 Fall 2018

### Guidelines for submission

From your Cloud9 IDE, grab this repository:

```
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/kiei924-fall18/hw2
cd hw2
./cleanup
```

This will create a directory called `hw2` in your Cloud9 IDE.

Complete the homework per the instructions in the `hw2.rb` file.

Use the "Share" button in the upper-right corner of the Cloud9 IDE to copy the link to your Cloud9 environment. This should be something like `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ide/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Use the URL as your "Web URL" submission in Canvas.
